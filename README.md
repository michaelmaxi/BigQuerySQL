**Interesting SQL Examples**

2. SQL GROUP BY and filtering with "HAVING" Example [Click Here](https://github.com/michaelmaxi/BigQuerySQL/tree/main/SQL%20HAVING%20CLAUSE) 
3. SQL OVER BY PARTITION allowing you to agregate with all records. Example [Click Here](https://github.com/michaelmaxi/BigQuerySQL/tree/main/SQL%20OVER%20BY%20PARTITION%20CLAUSE)
4. SQL Data type ARRAY - sequence of values known as 'element'.  We can get table information by using 'DESCRIBE' to find data_type = array<string>.  Now we can also filter on the values inside the array.  Example [Click Here](https://www.tellsomeonewhocares.com)
